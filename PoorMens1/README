This directory presents an alternative for the Haskell encoding in the
Shape suite. We build layered records rather than flat records. This
allows us to reuse structure from ancestor classes. This also allows
to reuse inherited methods. On the other hand, we have to make
explicit the subtyping relation (or substitution).
