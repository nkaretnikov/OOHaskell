This is a variation on SimpleIO.hs. (In fact, this is not a complete
reconstruction, but only a sketch.)  Using objects with mutable fields
in the context of ST monad Notable point: our labels and objects must
depend on the type 's' that represents a thread. This is natural: once
an object is instantiated, it can be used only in the same thread that
created that. In that sense, objects are a generalization of a STRef.

-- Our records are wrapped up in STRecord that carries the 's'
-- type (as a phantom type)

newtype STRecord s r = STRecord r

-- We modify the field applicator '#' to extract 's' from the object
-- and pass it to the label constructor. This will guarantee that
-- the desirable label has the same thread type 's' as that of the object.
-- This convention also makes _using_ of ST objects look precisely the
-- same as _using_ of the IORef objects.
