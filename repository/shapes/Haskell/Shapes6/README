This is (too) complicated variation on Shapes5.
We use a general two-parameter class Subtype.
(Before we use one type class per OO class.)
We only place the observation/mutation helpers in the Subtype class.
(Before we placed all OO methods in the type class.)
This seems to be limiting because virtual methods need extra classes.
