Straightforward experiments with covariant return types, as in Java 5.
We note that covariant return types are type-safe and conceptually not
very challenging. (The situation is all different to covariant
argument types, which are dealt with in CovariantArgs.hs.) Thanks are
due to Robin Green who suggested the sample scenario.

In cube, the method crossSection has a covariant result type.
We have to use (super .-. crossSection) rather than .<. super
