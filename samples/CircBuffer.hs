Illustration of a circular buffer, which is a naturally polymorphic
collection with strongly-typed access. We also illustrate classes in
local scope.

And here we come across something interesting. Our Buffer is a
polymorphic collection. Elements can be of any type. Until
very recently, one can't express this in Java and in C#. And here 
we didn't have to do anything at all. No extra
declarations necessary. The compiler has figured it all out (try
uncommenting the statement in testb2). We get the fully
static type checking of all collection operations. Another point: no
declaration for the type of testset: the compiler figured it all
out. We can print it out (and explain the printout).

		      insert .=. (\e -> do
				         putStr "Inserting: "
				         print e
				         superInsert e)
		      .*. (cb .-. insert)

         print "test2"

         testb2 class_logging_buffer
	 print "OK"

{-

Here we wrote a function that takes a constructor (a class!) and 
superimposed on the insert function. We
define a new class in a lexical scope. We pass the extended class to
the old function testb1, which would call the overridden function.
In C++ one can't define a new class
in a local scope. Classes are top level objects. In OOHaskell, an OO
class is just a parameterized object, which is first-class. We can
declare a class in a local scope -- without giving this any thought.
