- The ShapesGlb approach is rather useless.
- The ShapesEither implementation needs to make more reuse.
- Use this order: HasField r Draw (IO ())
- We need to cut down on redundancy, e.g., OCamlTutorial.hs vs. Selfish.hs
- Family needs to be cleaned up and/or documented, removed.
- UpCast1.hs? Not even tested.
- Door.hs? Not even tested.
- DML.hs? Not even tested.
- We need to separate worked out examples from incomplete stuff: LocalSigs, ...
- Should we try to challenge EiffelFAQ's test1 restriction?
- DeepNarrow relies on overlapping instances; either it shouldn't, or we could eliminate the extra effort for TopTyCon and still be overlapping.
