- The ShapesGlb approach is rather useless.
- The ShapesEither implementation needs to make more reuse.
- Use this notation: HasField r (Draw :=: IO ())
- We need to cut down on redundancy, e.g., OCamlTutorial.hs vs. Selfish.hs
- Family needs to be cleaned up and/or documented, removed.
- UpCast1.hs? Not even tested.
- Door.hs? Not even tested.
- DML.hs? Not even tested.
- We need to separate worked out examples from incomplete stuff: LocalSigs, ...
